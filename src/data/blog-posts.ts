# Beginner's Guide to Deriv Binary Options

Welcome to the exciting world of binary options trading! If you're new to this financial instrument, you've come to the right place. In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through everything you need to know to start trading binary options on the Deriv platform.

## What Are Binary Options?

Binary options are financial instruments that allow you to predict whether the price of an underlying asset will go up or down within a specific time frame. The term "binary" comes from the fact that there are only two possible outcomes: either your prediction is correct and you profit, or it's incorrect and you lose your investment.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Fixed payout**: You know exactly how much you can win or lose before placing the trade
- **Short timeframes**: Trades can last from 1 minute to several hours

### 2. Touch/No Touch
Predict whether the price will touch a specific barrier level during the contract period.

### 3. In/Out (Boundary)
Predict whether the price will stay within or break out of a price range.

### 4. Matches/Differs
Predict whether the final price will match a specific digit or be different.

## Essential Trading Concepts

### Market Analysis
Before placing any trade, analyze the market using:

### 2. Select Your Timeframes
- **Short-term**: 1-5 minutes (requires quick decision making)
- **Medium-term**: 15-60 minutes (more time for analysis)

### 3. Develop Entry Rules
Create clear criteria for when to enter trades:

# Top 5 Rise/Fall Strategies That Actually Work

After years of trading binary options and testing countless strategies, I've identified the top 5 rise/fall strategies that consistently deliver results. These aren't just theoretical concepts – they're battle-tested methods that I use in my daily trading.

## Strategy #1: The Moving Average Crossover

### Overview
This strategy uses two moving averages to identify trend changes and generate trading signals. It's perfect for beginners and incredibly reliable in trending markets.

### Setup
- **Fast MA**: 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- **Slow MA**: 25-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- **Timeframe**: 5-minute charts
- **Expiry**: 5-15 minutes

### Entry Rules

**CALL/RISE Signal:**
- Fast MA crosses above Slow MA
- Price is above both moving averages
- Confirm with RSI above 50
- Enter on the next candle after crossover

**PUT/FALL Signal:**
- Fast MA crosses below Slow MA  
- Price is below both moving averages
- Confirm with RSI below 50
- Enter on the next candle after crossover

### Why It Works
Moving averages smooth out price noise and clearly show trend direction. The crossover signals momentum changes early, giving you an edge in trend continuation trades.

### Success Rate
- **Trending markets**: 75-80%
- **Sideways markets**: 55-60%
- **Overall**: 68-72%

### Pro Tips
- Avoid trading during major news releases
- Best performance during London and New York sessions
- Use multiple timeframe confirmation for higher accuracy

## Strategy #2: Support and Resistance Bounces

### Overview
This strategy capitalizes on price reactions at key support and resistance levels. It's based on the principle that prices tend to bounce off these critical levels.

### Setup
- **Timeframe**: 15-minute charts for analysis, 5-minute for entry
- **Expiry**: 5-10 minutes
- **Assets**: Major forex pairs and indices

### Identifying Levels
1. **Support**: Previous lows where price bounced multiple times
2. **Resistance**: Previous highs where price was rejected
3. **Psychological levels**: Round numbers (1.2000, 1.3000, etc.)
4. **Pivot points**: Daily, weekly, monthly pivots

### Entry Rules

**CALL/RISE at Support:**
- Price approaches support level
- Bullish reversal candlestick pattern (hammer, doji, engulfing)
- Volume increase on the bounce
- RSI oversold (<30) and turning up

**PUT/FALL at Resistance:**
- Price approaches resistance level  
- Bearish reversal candlestick pattern (shooting star, hanging man)
- Volume increase on rejection
- RSI overbought (>70) and turning down

### Risk Management
- Only trade clear, well-tested levels
- Avoid weak support/resistance zones
- Maximum 3 attempts if level breaks

### Success Rate
- **Strong levels**: 78-85%
- **Weak levels**: 50-60%
- **Overall**: 70-75%

## Strategy #3: The RSI Divergence Strategy

### Overview
This advanced strategy identifies potential trend reversals by spotting divergences between price action and the RSI indicator.

### Setup
- **RSI Period**: 14
- **Timeframe**: 15-minute charts
- **Expiry**: 15-30 minutes
- **Additional Indicator**: MACD for confirmation

### Types of Divergence

**Bullish Divergence (CALL Signal):**
- Price makes lower lows
- RSI makes higher lows
- Indicates potential upward reversal

**Bearish Divergence (PUT Signal):**
- Price makes higher highs
- RSI makes lower highs
- Indicates potential downward reversal

### Entry Criteria
1. Identify clear divergence pattern
2. Wait for price to break structure (recent high/low)
3. Confirm with MACD signal line crossover
4. Enter on pullback to broken level

### Advanced Techniques
- **Hidden divergence**: Identifies trend continuation
- **Multi-timeframe**: Confirm on higher timeframe
- **Volume confirmation**: Higher volume on breakout

### Success Rate
- **Clear divergences**: 80-85%
- **Weak divergences**: 60-65%
- **Overall**: 72-77%

## Strategy #4: The Bollinger Band Squeeze

### Overview
This strategy exploits periods of low volatility followed by explosive price movements. When Bollinger Bands contract (squeeze), it signals an impending breakout.

### Setup
- **Bollinger Bands**: 20-period, 2 standard deviations
- **Additional Indicator**: TTM Squeeze or Band Width
- **Timeframe**: 5-15 minute charts
- **Expiry**: 10-30 minutes

### Identifying the Squeeze
- Bollinger Bands narrow significantly
- Price consolidates in tight range
- Volume decreases during consolidation
- TTM Squeeze indicator shows compression

### Entry Rules

**CALL/RISE:**
- Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
- Volume expansion on breakout
- RSI above 50
- MACD showing bullish momentum

**PUT/FALL:**
- Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band
- Volume expansion on breakout  
- RSI below 50
- MACD showing bearish momentum

### Key Success Factors
- Patience to wait for clear breakouts
- Strong volume confirmation
- Avoid false breakouts in ranging markets
- Best during active trading sessions

### Success Rate
- **Clear breakouts**: 82-88%
- **False breakouts**: 45-50%
- **Overall**: 74-79%

## Strategy #5: The Triple Confirmation System

### Overview
This is my personal favorite strategy that combines multiple indicators for high-probability trades. It requires three confirmations before entry, ensuring quality over quantity.

### Setup
- **Primary**: 20 EMA trend direction
- **Secondary**: MACD histogram
- **Confirmation**: Stochastic oscillator
- **Timeframe**: 5-15 minute charts
- **Expiry**: 10-15 minutes

### Triple Confirmation Rules

**CALL/RISE Requirements:**
1. **Trend**: Price above 20 EMA (uptrend)
2. **Momentum**: MACD histogram turning positive
3. **Timing**: Stochastic crossing up from oversold (<20)

**PUT/FALL Requirements:**
1. **Trend**: Price below 20 EMA (downtrend)
2. **Momentum**: MACD histogram turning negative  
3. **Timing**: Stochastic crossing down from overbought (>80)

### Entry Process
1. Identify trend direction with 20 EMA
2. Wait for MACD momentum confirmation
3. Enter when Stochastic provides timing signal
4. All three must align for valid entry

### Why This Works
- Reduces false signals significantly
- Ensures you're trading with the trend
- Provides optimal entry timing
- Filters out low-probability setups

### Success Rate
- **All confirmations aligned**: 85-90%
- **Two confirmations**: 60-65%
- **Overall**: 78-83%

## General Trading Rules for All Strategies

### Money Management
- Risk only 2-5% of account per trade
- Use fixed stake amounts initially
- Increase position size only with proven success
- Set daily loss limits

### Market Conditions
- Best performance during trending markets
- Avoid major news events
- Trade during active sessions
- Watch for market volatility

### Psychology
- Follow your trading plan strictly
- Don't chase losses
- Take profits when targets are hit
- Review and analyze all trades

## Choosing the Right Strategy

### For Beginners
Start with **Moving Average Crossover** – it's simple and effective.

### For Intermediate Traders
Try **Support/Resistance Bounces** to understand market structure.

### For Advanced Traders
Use **RSI Divergence** or **Triple Confirmation** for higher accuracy.

### For All Levels
**Bollinger Band Squeeze** works well across experience levels.

## Backtesting and Optimization

Before using any strategy with real money:
1. **Backtest** on historical data
2. **Forward test** on demo account
3. **Optimize** parameters for your style
4. **Start small** with real money
5. **Scale up** gradually

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Strategy-Specific Errors
- Ignoring market context
- Taking low-quality setups
- Not waiting for confirmations
- Overriding strategy rules

### General Errors
- Emotional decision making
- Poor risk management
- Lack of discipline
- Insufficient practice

## Conclusion

These five strategies have been tested over thousands of trades and multiple market conditions. The key to success isn't finding the "perfect" strategy – it's finding one that fits your personality and consistently following it.

Remember:
- **Quality over quantity** – wait for high-probability setups
- **Discipline beats discretion** – follow your rules
- **Patience pays** – let the strategy work
- **Consistency wins** – small, steady profits compound

Start with one strategy, master it completely, then consider adding others to your arsenal. Each has its strengths and optimal market conditions.

# Risk Management: How Not to Blow Your Account

In my years of trading binary options, I've seen countless talented traders lose everything because they ignored one fundamental principle: risk management. You can have the best strategy in the world, but without proper risk management, you'll eventually blow your account. In this comprehensive guide, I'll share the exact risk management techniques that have kept me profitable for years.

## The Harsh Reality of Trading

Before we dive into specific techniques, let's address the elephant in the room: **95% of new traders lose money**. But here's the thing – it's rarely because they can't analyze markets or pick good trades. They lose because they don't manage risk properly.

### Common Account-Destroying Behaviors:
- Risking too much per trade
- Revenge trading after losses
- No stop-loss strategy
- Emotional decision making
- Lack of trading plan
- Overconfidence after wins

The good news? All of these are preventable with proper risk management.

## The 1% Rule: Your Account's Best Friend

### What Is the 1% Rule?

Never risk more than 1% of your trading account on a single trade. If you have $1,000, your maximum risk per trade is $10. If you have $10,000, it's $100.

### Why 1% Works

**Mathematical Advantage:**
- You can lose 50 trades in a row and still have 60% of your account left
- Gives you room for strategy refinement
- Removes emotional pressure from individual trades
- Allows for natural trading variance

**Psychological Benefits:**
- Reduces trading stress
- Prevents revenge trading
- Maintains clear thinking
- Builds long-term mindset

### Adjusting for Different Risk Tolerances

**Conservative Traders**: 0.5% per trade
**Balanced Approach**: 1% per trade  
**Aggressive Traders**: 2% per trade (maximum recommended)
**Professional Prop Traders**: Up to 3% (with strict rules)

**Never exceed 5% per trade under any circumstances.**

## Position Sizing Strategies

### Fixed Dollar Amount

**Method**: Risk the same dollar amount on every trade
**Example**: Always risk $20 per trade regardless of account size
**Pros**: Simple to implement, consistent risk
**Cons**: Doesn't scale with account growth

### Fixed Percentage

**Method**: Risk the same percentage of current account balance
**Example**: Always risk 2% of current balance
**Pros**: Scales with account, compound growth
**Cons**: Requires recalculation after significant changes

### Kelly Criterion

**Method**: Mathematical formula based on win rate and average win/loss
**Formula**: f = (bp - q) / b
- f = fraction of capital to risk
- b = odds received (payout ratio)
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1-p)

**Example**: 60% win rate, 80% payout
f = (0.8 × 0.6 - 0.4) / 0.8 = 0.1 = 10%

**Warning**: Kelly can suggest very high percentages. Use a fractional Kelly (1/4 or 1/2 of suggested amount) for safety.

### Optimal Position Sizing Model

For binary options, I recommend this hybrid approach:

1. **Base size**: 1-2% of account
2. **Strategy confidence**: Multiply by 0.5-1.5
3. **Market conditions**: Multiply by 0.8-1.2
4. **Recent performance**: Multiply by 0.8-1.2

**Example Calculation:**
- Account: $5,000

## The Power of Diversification

### Asset Diversification

Don't put all your eggs in one basket:
- **Forex pairs**: 30-40% of trades
- **Commodities**: 20-30% of trades
- **Indices**: 20-30% of trades
- **Volatility indices**: 10-20% of trades

### Strategy Diversification

Use multiple strategies to spread risk:
- **Trend following**: For trending markets
- **Mean reversion**: For ranging markets  
- **Breakout strategies**: For high volatility
- **News trading**: For event-driven moves

### Time Diversification

Spread trades across different timeframes:
- **Short-term**: 1-5 minute expiries (40% of trades)
- **Medium-term**: 15-60 minute expiries (40% of trades)
- **Long-term**: 1+ hour expiries (20% of trades)

## Daily and Weekly Risk Limits

### Daily Loss Limits

Set a maximum daily loss and stick to it religiously.

**Recommended Daily Limits:**
- **Conservative**: 3-5% of account
- **Moderate**: 5-8% of account
- **Aggressive**: 8-10% of account

**When you hit your daily limit:**
1. Close all charts
2. Step away from the computer
3. Analyze what went wrong
4. Come back tomorrow fresh

### Weekly Loss Limits

**Weekly limit**: 15-20% of account maximum

If you hit this limit:
- Take a break for the rest of the week
- Review all trades
- Identify patterns in losses
- Adjust strategy if needed

### Monthly Drawdown Rules

**Maximum monthly drawdown**: 25% of account

Recovery strategies when approaching limits:
- Reduce position sizes by 50%
- Only trade your highest probability setups
- Consider taking a break
- Review and refine strategies

## Emotional Risk Management

### Recognizing Emotional States

**Dangerous emotional states for trading:**
- Anger after losses
- Overconfidence after wins
- Desperation to recover losses
- Boredom leading to overtrading
- Fear causing missed opportunities

### The Emotional Circuit Breaker

Implement automatic rules for emotional situations:

**After 3 consecutive losses:**
- Take a 15-minute break
- Review your strategy
- Ensure you're following rules
- Only continue if you're calm

**After 5 consecutive wins:**
- Take a break to avoid overconfidence
- Review if you're getting lucky
- Stick to position sizing rules
- Don't increase risk

### Mindfulness Techniques

**Pre-Trading Routine:**
1. 5 minutes of deep breathing
2. Review your trading plan
3. Check economic calendar
4. Set daily risk limits
5. Confirm you're in the right mindset

**During Trading:**
- Monitor your emotional state
- Take breaks between trades
- Don't rush decisions
- Stick to your plan

**Post-Trading Review:**
- Analyze emotional decisions
- Identify improvement areas
- Celebrate disciplined trading
- Plan for tomorrow

## The Martingale Trap (And Why to Avoid It)

### What Is Martingale?

Doubling your bet after each loss, attempting to recover all previous losses with one win.

**Example:**
- Trade 1: Lose $10 (Total loss: $10)
- Trade 2: Risk $20, lose (Total loss: $30)  
- Trade 3: Risk $40, lose (Total loss: $70)
- Trade 4: Risk $80, win $64 (Net loss: $6)

### Why Martingale Destroys Accounts

**Mathematical Problems:**
- Exponential growth of required capital
- Even small losing streaks become unmanageable
- 10 losses in a row requires 1,024x original bet

**Real Example with $1,000 account:**
- Start: $10 trade
- After 7 losses: Need $1,280 for next trade
- Account already blown before recovery possible

**Psychological Problems:**
- Increases stress exponentially
- Forces emotional decisions
- Ignores proper risk management
- Creates all-or-nothing mentality

### Safe Alternatives to Martingale

**Fixed Fractional Position Sizing:**
- Always risk same percentage
- Naturally decreases bet size after losses
- Increases bet size after wins
- Mathematically sound

**Anti-Martingale (Reverse Martingale):**
- Increase bet size after wins
- Decrease after losses
- Rides winning streaks
- Limits losing streaks

## Advanced Risk Management Techniques

### Portfolio Heat

Monitor total risk across all open positions.

**Portfolio Heat Formula:**
Total Risk = Sum of all position risks

**Maximum portfolio heat**: 10-15% of account

**Example:**
- 5 open trades, each risking 2%
- Total portfolio heat: 10%
- No new trades until some close

### Correlation Risk

Avoid taking multiple correlated positions.

**High correlation pairs:**
- EUR/USD and GBP/USD
- Gold and Silver
- Oil and Canadian Dollar
- Tech stocks and NASDAQ

**Risk management:**
- Limit correlated positions to 5% total risk
- Treat correlated trades as single large position
- Monitor correlation changes during high volatility

### Time-Based Risk Limits

**Hourly limits**: Maximum 3-5 trades per hour
**Session limits**: Maximum 15-20 trades per session
**Consecutive trade limits**: Maximum 3 consecutive trades without break

### The Kelly-Modified Approach

Combine Kelly Criterion with conservative limits:

1. Calculate Kelly percentage
2. Take 25% of Kelly suggestion
3. Apply maximum 3% limit
4. Adjust for market conditions

**Example:**
- Kelly suggests 12%
- Take 25%: 3%
- Apply 3% maximum: 3%
- Poor market conditions: 2.4%

## Technology for Risk Management

### Automated Position Sizing

**Spreadsheet tools:**
- Automatic percentage calculations
- Account balance tracking
- Position size recommendations
- Risk limit monitoring

**Trading software features:**
- Built-in position sizing calculators
- Automatic risk limit enforcement  
- Portfolio heat monitoring
- Correlation analysis tools

### Alert Systems

Set up alerts for:
- Daily loss limits approached
- Portfolio heat exceeding limits
- Unusual correlation increases
- Emotional trading patterns

## Risk Management Across Different Market Conditions

### Trending Markets

**Adjust risk for trend trades:**
- Increase position size for trend direction
- Decrease for counter-trend trades
- Use wider stop losses
- Allow for trend continuation

### Ranging Markets

**Range-bound adjustments:**
- Standard position sizing
- Shorter expiry times
- Quick profit taking
- Tight risk management

### High Volatility Markets

**Volatile market adjustments:**
- Reduce position sizes by 25-50%
- Extend expiry times
- Expect wider price swings
- Increase break frequency

### News Event Trading

**Special risk considerations:**
- Reduce position sizes before major news
- Avoid trading during news releases
- Expect increased volatility
- Have predetermined exit strategy

## Building Your Personal Risk Management System

### Step 2: Create Your Rules

**Essential rules to establish:**

### Step 3: Document Everything

Create a written risk management plan:
- Clear rules and limits

- Review schedules
- Performance metrics

### Step 4: Backtest Your System

Test your risk management:
- Apply rules to historical trades
- Calculate maximum drawdowns

### Step 5: Implement Gradually

**Month 1**: Focus on position sizing
**Month 2**: Add daily limits
**Month 3**: Implement weekly limits
**Month 4**: Add emotional management
**Month 5**: Fine-tune all rules

## Monitoring and Adjustment

### Weekly Performance Review

**Questions to ask:**
- Did I follow my risk rules?
- What was my maximum daily loss?
- How many times did I hit limits?
- Were there emotional trading decisions?
- What needs adjustment?

### Monthly Risk Assessment

**Metrics to track:**
- Maximum drawdown

### Quarterly Strategy Adjustment

**Major review areas:**
- Risk tolerance changes

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: The Revenge Trader

**Background**: Trader loses 5 trades in a row, total loss $150
**Mistake**: Doubles next trade to $300 to "get even quickly"
**Result**: Loses the large trade, total loss now $450
**Solution**: Would have risked normal $30, total loss only $180

**Lesson**: Revenge trading multiplies losses exponentially

### Case Study 2: The Hot Streak Trader

**Background**: Trader wins 8 trades in a row, feeling invincible
**Mistake**: Increases position size thinking they "can't lose"
**Result**: Next 3 trades lose, giving back all profits
**Solution**: Maintain consistent position sizing regardless of recent results

**Lesson**: Hot streaks end, discipline is permanent

### Case Study 3: The Diversification Success

**Background**: Trader spreads risk across multiple assets and timeframes
**Result**: Forex trades lose during news, but volatility indices remain profitable
**Outcome**: Overall portfolio remains positive despite sector-specific losses

**Lesson**: Diversification smooths out performance

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "Just This Once" Mentality

**Example**: "I'll risk 5% just this once because I'm really confident"
**Why it's dangerous**: Rules only work if followed consistently
**Solution**: Never make exceptions to risk rules

### Mistake 2: Not Adjusting for Account Changes

**Example**: Account grows from $1,000 to $2,000, but still risk $50 per trade
**Problem**: Now risking 2.5% instead of 5%
**Solution**: Regularly recalculate position sizes

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Correlation Risk

**Example**: Taking 5 different trades, all on correlated EUR pairs
**Problem**: Actually risking 5x intended amount on single currency
**Solution**: Monitor and limit correlated positions

### Mistake 4: No Emergency Plan

**Example**: Trader has no plan for significant losses
**Problem**: Emotional decisions during worst times
**Solution**: Predetermined actions for various loss levels
